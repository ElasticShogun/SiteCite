Database (And Other) Issues:
* DBLogin.php has the credentials, but I hardcoded them because of a bug I was having
* Processing.php is where the credentials are hardcoded.
* I exported the database, but the "students" table did not import correctly, and I have not fixed it yet
* CAS Login is used, and authentication is checked for some pages, but it is by no means rigourous at this point. 
* A majority of the site is still fairly content bare, but that can be amended.
* File exportation is not yet supported
